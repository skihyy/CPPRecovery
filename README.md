# CPPRecovery

This repo is used for recover my ability to write C++. I learnt and wrote a lot of C++ in my freshman and sephormor year. Then I transferred to Java. 

Those code follows the book "C++ How to Program, 5th edition" by Deitel & Associates, Inc. Each folder "ch#" meaning the chapter, inside which every folder means a separate program focused on the chapter.
